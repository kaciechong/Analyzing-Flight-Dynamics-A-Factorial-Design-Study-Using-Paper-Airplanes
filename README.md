# Analyzing Flight Dynamics: A Factorial Design Study Using Paper Airplanes
  *PSTAT 115 - Final Project*
  
* Goal: Conduct a 2³ factorial experiment to evaluate how nose, middle, and rear clip placements—and their interactions—affect flight distance, using linear modeling and statistical validation in R
